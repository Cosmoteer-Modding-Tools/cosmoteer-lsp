/**
 * Whole-file document roots: files whose top-level fields are themselves a schema class, e.g. a
 * shot file is a `BulletRules`, an effect file is a `MediaEffectRules` (chosen by its top-level
 * `Type`). This is distinct from a part file, where a named `Part { … }` group is the root (see
 * `ROOT_GROUP_CLASSES`).
 *
 * Two resolution paths, tried in order:
 *  1. **Content dispatch** — a top-level `Type = <disc>` that names a member of a whole-file-root
 *     registry (media effects, music, doodads). Path-independent and self-describing, so the
 *     effect/music files scattered across many folders (crew, statuses, nebulas, …) root correctly
 *     wherever they live.
 *  2. **Path-scoped rule** — for files a fixed class with no `Type` discriminator (a resource, a
 *     status, a nebula), or a registry whose discriminators are too generic to dispatch globally
 *     (name generators). Fixed classes are guarded by a required top-level field so the effect and
 *     index files that share the same folder are not mis-rooted.
 *
 * Every candidate is finally self-validated by {@link classFitsDocument} (it must own a majority of
 * the document's top-level fields), which guards against loose path matches and generic
 * discriminators. Conservative on purpose: a wrong root mis-types fields, so only add a mapping
 * after confirming the whole-vanilla scan stays warning- and mis-root-free.
