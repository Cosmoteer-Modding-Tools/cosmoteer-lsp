## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Full feature parity with the VS Code extension via LSP4IJ: pull diagnostics with all opt-in validators, completion with snippets, hover, navigation, find usages, rename, formatting, quick fixes, signature help, inlay hints, color swatches, document links, workspace symbols and semantic-token highlighting for `.rules` and `.shader` files.
- Live WebGL shader preview in a tool window, opened from a gutter icon on `Shader = …` lines, the editor context menu, or the Tools menu.
- Mod overview report for `mod.rules` manifests (gutter icon and context menu).
- Settings page under Settings | Tools | Cosmoteer Rules mirroring every `cosmoteerLSPRules.*` option. Changes apply to running servers without a restart.
- Localized server messages following the IDE language (English and German).
- File icons for `.rules` and `.shader` files, via registered TextMate-backed file types. The registration also stops the IDE from advertising other marketplace plugins for these extensions.
- Setting to enable LSP semantic-token highlighting on top of the TextMate colors (off by default: the overlay repaints asynchronously after every edit, which looks like flickering).
- Node.js is no longer a hard prerequisite: when no runtime is configured or on PATH, the plugin offers to download a private copy of the official Node.js LTS build (checksum-verified, about 30 MB, only the `node` executable is kept) and starts the server with it.

### Changed

- Rebuilt on LSP4IJ instead of the Ultimate-only native LSP API: the plugin now runs on Rider, IntelliJ IDEA Community and every other JetBrains IDE (2024.2+), and no longer needs the JavaScript plugin or a configured Node interpreter, only Node.js on PATH or in the settings.
